# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR or open an Issue.

## Setup your developer Environment

To setup your enviroment, first make sure you followed the official [Roku Developer environment setup](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md).

You also need to have the [BRS](https://npmjs.org/package/brs) and [BrighterScript](https://npmjs.org/package/brighterscript) `npm` packages installed: 

```shell script
npm install -g brs
npm install -g brighterscript
npm install -g ropm
```

### Running the static analysis

The whole project is covered by a set of static analysis tools, which can be launched via `npm`.

```shell script
npm run lint
```

### Running the tests

The whole project is covered by a set of tests using [Roca](https://hulu.github.io/roca/), which can be launched via `npm`.

```shell script
npm test
```

### Running the sample app

A sample app is available to showcase the basic features of the SDK. You can package the app with `npm`.

```shell script
npm run make-sample
```

Then you can upload the `sample/dist/apps/DatadogSampleApp.zip` file to your Roku device, using the Development Application Installer. Alternatively, you can set the `ROKU_DEV_TARGET` environment variable to your device's IP address, the `ROKU_DEV_PASSWORD` environment variable to your device's dev password, and run one of the following `npm` command:

```shell script
npm run install-sample
npm run run-sample
```


## Submitting Issues

Many great ideas for new features come from the community, and we'd be happy to

with the details about what you'd like to see. At a minimum, please provide:

 - The goal of the new feature;
 - A description of how it might be used or behave;
 - Links to any important resources (e.g. Github repos, websites, screenshots,

 - Screenshots, links, or other visual aids that are publicly accessible;
 - Code sample or test that reproduces the problem;
 - An explanation of what causes the bug and/or how it can be fixed.

Reports that include rich detail are better, and ones with code that reproduce
the bug are best.

## Have a patch?

We welcome code contributions to the library, which you can 
[submit as a pull request](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-roku/pull/new/develop).
Before you submit a PR, make sure that you first create an Issue to explain the
bug or the feature your patch covers, and make sure another Issue or PR doesn't
already exist.

To create a pull request:

5. **Update any documentation**, especially for new features;
6. **Submit the pull request** from your fork back to this 
    [repository](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-roku) .


The pull request will be run through our CI pipeline, and a project member will
review the changes with you. At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, pull
requests must:

 - Have a stated goal and detailed description of the changes made;
 - Include thorough test coverage and documentation, where applicable;
 - Pass all tests and code quality checks (linting/coverage/benchmarks) on CI;
